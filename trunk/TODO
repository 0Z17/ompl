* Reorganize tests to be more general, move python tests from py-bindings to test directory.
* Merge files for tests for util/ & tests for datastructures/.
* Implement benchmarks for control/ not only for geometric/ (nice to have, not essential for release).
* Define a parameter structure for classes that have parameters
   - perhaps something that will allow parameter sweeps
     (see code in unused/) (for later).
* Create a more complex ODE demo (nice to have).
* Path smoothing with splines.
* Make python bindings work again.
* Add demo for GoalLazySampler using Inverse Kinematics code.
