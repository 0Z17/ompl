* Reorganize tests to be more general
* Merge files for tests for util/ & tests for datastructures/.
* Define a parameter structure for classes that have parameters
   - perhaps something that will allow parameter sweeps
     (see code in unused/) (for later).
* Create a more complex ODE demo (nice to have).
* Path smoothing with splines.
* Expose ODE extension through Python bindings.
