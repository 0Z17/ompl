1. Organize the test_geometric / test_control better
   so that the StateManifold is defined in a single place
2. merge tests for util/ & tests for datastructures/
3. implement benchmarks for control/ not only for geometric/
4. memory free does not actually always happen after memory has been allocated. Try benchmark with fork() for each process we run. Or perhaps always run it as a separate process? (boost::process)
   
5. add a more detailed example for ScopedState in documentation

6. define a parameter structure for classes that have parameters
   - perhaps something that will allow parameter sweeps
     (see code in unused/)

7. finish ode extension
8. document how to compile / link against ompl
