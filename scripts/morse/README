Right now there are 2 scripts in this directory: external.py and plugin.py. You can
leave external.py where it is and as is. But it is important that you edit line 8 in
plugin.py so that OMPL_DIR is your ompl_morse directory.

TODO: figure out how to install plugin.py properly into Blender

In the meantime, the bgetest.blend file is included with this plugin already loaded
so you can run it. Just run 'blender bgetest.blend' from the terminal so you can
monitor the output. Don't forget to edit line 8 in Blender. To start the game
engine, press 'P'; the plugin will activate 1 second into the simulation; then
press 'Esc' to stop.

Expected results:
- the cube will fall
- the terminal should display something like:
    Blender Game Engine Started
    received command: extractState()
    received command: submitState([((0.0, 0.0, -4.937804698944092), (1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 
    0.0), (0.0, 0.0, -9.67292308807373), (0.0, 0.0, 0.0))])
    received command: quit()
    Blender Game Engine Finished
- newly created file ext.out should be empty (no errors or traceback)
