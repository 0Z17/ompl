This is the vf_rrt branch, implementing the VFRRT planner.

Notes:
 - VFRRT inherits from RRT. Maybe it would be cleaner to have it be separate.
 - there are two optimization objectives added: the upstream criterion and mechanical work.
 - the vector field is represented as a VectorField class, inside VFRRT. It might as well
	just be a boost::function<> typedef though.

Running the demos:
 - 'bin/demo_VectorFieldConservative':
 	- generates paths through a hilly potential field
	- uses VFRRT(upstream), TRRT(mechanical work), and RRT*(upstream)
	- outputs to files '{vfrrt,trrt,rrtstar}-conservative.path'
	- run 'demos/plotVectorFieldConservative.py' to plot the data
 - 'bin/demo_VectorFieldNonconservative':
	- generates a path through a rotating field
	- uses VFRRT(upstream)
	- outputs to file 'vfrrt-nonconservative.path'
	- run 'demos/plotVectorFieldNonconservative.py' to plot the data
