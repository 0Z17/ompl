* Merge files for tests for util/ & tests for datastructures/.
* Expose ODE extension through Python bindings.
* Make PlannerData use BGL
* Make projections use ublas (boost)
* Start another 'concept' for ompl -- something that has algorithms for the analysis of spaces to plan in: Identify good lengths of path segments, good discretizations of control sets, automatic setting of parameters (projection cell sizes?), identification of good random projections
* Move propagation routines outside the control space, as a separate class; register that class with control::SpaceInformation
